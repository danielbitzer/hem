"""Configuration loading.

Three sources, resolved independently:

- Environment (EnvSettings, pydantic-settings): HEM_* env vars and hem/.env.
  Under the Supervisor, SUPERVISOR_TOKEN wins and the proxy URLs are used;
  standalone needs HEM_HA_URL + HEM_HA_TOKEN.
- Supervisor options (/data/options.json): log_level ONLY — everything else
  is configured in the web UI (issue #5).
- The HEM-owned config document (see config_store): the pydantic Settings
  model below, edited via the dashboard's Settings view and validated here —
  the exact model the planner consumes, so the UI can never accept a config
  the app would reject.
