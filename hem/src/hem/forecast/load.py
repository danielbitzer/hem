"""Household load forecasting — learned from actual consumption, or nothing.

There is deliberately no hand-typed hourly profile: HistoryLoadForecaster
learns hour-of-day × weekday/weekend averages from the household's real
consumption (entities.load_power), refreshed daily. Preferred data source is
hourly long-term statistics (which survive recorder purging, so the window
can be months), falling back to raw recorder history (~10 days) for sensors
without a state_class.

With an outdoor temperature sensor configured (entities.outdoor_temp), the
daily learn also fits a temperature response: pooled cooling/heating slopes
(kW per degree above/below balance temperatures) regressed against each hour
bucket's deviation from its own average. forecast() then applies the FORECAST
temperatures to those slopes — so the prediction tracks a heatwave arriving
after a mild fortnight instead of the trailing average lagging it. The model
is only ever fitted on hours where load AND temperature overlap, so a young
temperature sensor caps the effective window rather than skewing the fit.

Until learning succeeds (no load sensor configured, or no usable history yet)
HEM plans with ZERO house load and reports the degraded state via `status`,
which the dashboard and hem_status surface as a warning. The documented
mitigation is raising battery.soc_min until learning is active.
