"""Reconstruct a plain-language explanation of the current action.

The MILP optimises the whole horizon and emits a schedule, not a reason — so
this is a faithful *narration of the numbers* that make step 0's action
optimal (the price's rank in the forecast, the hold value it's weighed
against, which soft levers are armed), never a claim about the solver's
internals. Everything here is derived from the finished plan plus the levers
that fed the solve, so it can't disagree with what was actually published.
