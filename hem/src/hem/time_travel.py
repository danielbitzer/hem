"""Test mode, time travel: replay a past window from recorded HA history.

Given a historical instant, this rebuilds the optimizer's inputs from what the
recorder actually captured — Amber prices, house load, PV generation, battery
SoC — and runs the same solver the live loop uses. It answers "how would my
(current or overridden) settings have behaved across this real day?" without
waiting for the real data to change.

Honesty note baked into the response: these are recorded ACTUALS, i.e. perfect
hindsight — not the forecast HEM saw at the time — so the replay shows how the
settings value the real prices, not a re-run of the historical decision.

Read-only like the synthetic scenarios: never publishes sensors or touches the
live plan. Reach limits: raw recorder history only (~10 days by default);
beyond that the response says so instead of silently padding.
