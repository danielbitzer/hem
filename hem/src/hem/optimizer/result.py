    - CHARGE: charging beyond the PV surplus — i.e. buying from the grid.

      i.e. self-consumption would charge, but the plan defers the charge to a
      cheaper window. Block charging, still cover load dips.

      battery, charging from excess PV, or importing to serve load) — the
      inverter's native mode does this with second-by-second load tracking a
      5-min setpoint can't match. (The battery-idle-under-import case — hold
